## Introduction

This portfolio website was build using ReactJS and styled with Boostrap. I will be using this project to evolve my skills as a developer and will continue to add more features along the way. <br />

## Overview

Everything is contained within App.js, which renders the Home.js, About.js, Work.js, and Contact.js pages. App.js holds all the state data and passes them along as props to the components that need them. <br />
